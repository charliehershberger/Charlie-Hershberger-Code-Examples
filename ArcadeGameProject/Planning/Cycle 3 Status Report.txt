Cycle 3 start
enemies have most motion, can die, but don't add points when they die. This will take about one hour.
main gun works, but fires infinitely, other guns have bullet overlap. this will take about one hour.
AI need to stop throwing errors when they move. This will take one hour.
score and lives don't exist and can't be displayed this will take 1 hours to complete.
we need to make a splash screen this will take one hour to create.

Cycle 3 end
All the enemies have full motion, AI, and attributes. 
This took 5 hours non-continuously because centipede has more loops than one person can easily navigate. 
When they die and assign points.
This took less than an hour because I made methods to do this in the earlier revisions in the game.
Killing enemies creates an image of their points value next to where they died. 
This took 1 hour even though we had to create a new class to handle the strings
All guns fire, kill and can be properly selected. Guns now fire at a reasonable frequency. 
Levels can be played, work, and automatically change.
The player has full motion in the player's area but can't move outside of the area or move through mushrooms.
There is a score and live system that restarts the game after you lose all your lives. 
This took 2 hours due to confusion as to how we could display lives and points, 
leading to creating a information bar.
There is a pause System and a splash screen
This took 1 hour to get a basic screen with images, 
but further work took 1 hour due to complications of painting in threads.

We are essentially done now, but there are a few bugs to squash 
and we want to make the splash screen "better" and show up more often.
