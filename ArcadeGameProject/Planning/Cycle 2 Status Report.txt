CYCLE 2 START:
We have already implemented the method that kills the mushrooms 
and changes the image that goes with them.

The hero can already be killed but we still have to work to to make centipede kill the player. 
This modification should only be about 3 hours if it works right.

We are making the centipede move back and forth with classic motion. 
The plan is to use linked lists to insure that the centipede follows the centipede in front of it.
I imagine a time of 5+ work hours on this due to errors that we've encountererd. 



The plan is to use the bullet's implementation to kill the centipede 
and use the linked list to split the centipede: Killing should be about an hour, splitting will
probably end up taking like 5 hours

CYCLE 2 END: 

The centipede killing the player required less code modification than we thought it would, that 
only took about an hour

The classic centipede was moved away from a true linked list implementation and it did take about
5+ hours to get it to move right. We also discovered a display problem that helped the centipede
display better

Splitting was less than an hour due to Jacob discovering that dropping mushrooms causes things to 
work out nicely for split & reversal
