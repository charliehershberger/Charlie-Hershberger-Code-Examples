We built the leader board out of splash screen and load level code. 
We used load level for all the file processing, and
We used splash screen to draw the board.
We found out how to write to file using based stack over flow.
We decided to do a sorting algorithm into the arraylist and 
We made the arraylist automatically resize to 10 or the minimum required size.

We have started playing the game and it is very fun. However it is equally traumatic.
