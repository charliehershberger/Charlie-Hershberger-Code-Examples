CYCLE 1 START:
Right now we have planned out our classes. We should have the frame and board made so it can
draw object and that there are object classes to draw on the frame.

We will also work on a function that will load a game with mushrooms in it and save it.

There should also be a main menu that can be quitted from the current game to and have new games
started there.

We think this should take 1 hour to to make the frame with buttons work. 
1 hour to make the file loading work. 3 hours to make all the classes with motion work.

CYCLE 1 SUBMIT:
Amusing as this sentence may be to read, everything here took like 3 times as long as expected
and nothing worked like we initially wanted it to.

The Frame took no time at all but getting they keyboard to work required knowing key binding,
which took about 2 hours to learn and implement with the other code we had. 

File loading took 3 hours to write and debug because nothing worked as expected initially.
We had to properly locate files and make a game board. Then we had to rewrite some of Level 
becuase it needed to make a new game board every time. 

The classes with motion so far have taken about 4+ hours to write and make move properly.
Key binding was a big part of it, but general troubleshooting with board size and level
loading hindered progress.
