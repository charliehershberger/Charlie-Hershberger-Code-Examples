When we were making the centipede move back and forth with classic motion, 
The plan was to use linked lists to insure that the centipede follows the centipede in front of it,
however, having each part of the centipede be its own centipede works just as well.
However, my linked list system worked on the first try, so that was cool.

The plan was to use the bullet's implementation to kill the centipede, 
but bullets can't kill moving objects so more work is required 
We planned to use the linked list to split the centipede, 
but that was not necessary because we no longer use linked lists for centipede
